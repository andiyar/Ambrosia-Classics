# NEXT — the chip for the next unattended loop run (rewritten by every run at CLOSE)

You are the ORCHESTRATOR for **Ferazel's Wand** in Ambrosia Classics — mission: **get Ferazel's Wand DONE**: the whole
game as design §1 defines it (all 24 levels, world map, saves, spells, enemies, bosses, victory; then Windows), built
phase by phase in Ben's order (design §8), machine-gated by you, feel-gated by Ben. **Ben is away (Fiji, from
2026-10-13, a few days) and wants to come back to a playable, or at least testable, game — get as much done as you
can, in order, without cutting corners on the 100 % rule.** Repo `/Users/andiyar/Developer/Ambrosia-Classics`
(`$REPO`); local-only — **never push, fetch, or touch a remote**. You are already in your own worktree on your own
`loop/<N>-<stamp>` branch (the looper made it from `main`); verify `git branch --show-current` before EVERY commit.
Invoke `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` first. House method: `~/Developer/Toolkits/fable-kit/orchestrator.md`
(§2 loop, §3 subagent brief, §5 cap, §6 model policy) and `opus-driver.md` §3. Echo the mission in one sentence, say
what you'll do first, start.

## MODEL SEAT (Ben 2026-10-07 + 2026-10-13; CLAUDE.md "Workflow"; D34)
- You are Opus 5.5 (the looper's `MODEL`). Every implementer and reviewer is `fk-implementer` / `fk-reviewer` with
  **NO `model` param** (frontmatter pins `claude-opus-5-5`; `"opus"` there is the wrong Opus). Never Sonnet/Haiku,
  never general-purpose for typed work. Floor: one implementer + one reviewer per task; ⚑ MAJOR = two Opus review legs.
- **Fable 5.1 is the cross-check, not the gate.** Exactly these Fable legs (`fk-reviewer` with `model: "fable"`,
  named "FABLE-GRADE gate" in its prompt; it re-runs the gates itself): (1) **each phase plan**, once, after its two
  Opus review legs, before execution; (2) **each phase end**, once, over the phase's whole diff
  (`git diff <phase-start SHA>..HEAD`) plus the gate card, before staging; (3) a tie-break when two Opus legs
  contradict each other on a MAJOR finding and one fix round did not settle it (log "Fable tie-break" in LOOP-LOG).
  **This chip narrows the kit's standing prompt for this project:** its Fable list also names "a task the plan marks
  MAJOR" and "an exact port from a binary" — here that would be most tasks, which is the per-gate spending Ben stopped
  on 2026-10-07 (memory `feedback-no-fable-gate-every-task`; D34). Nothing else runs on Fable. Fable findings are
  fixed by Opus implementers before the phase is staged. If Fable is unavailable, record "Fable check owed" in STATE +
  QUESTIONS and continue.
- Stop finished subagents (`TaskStop`) when their notice says background work is still running.

## CAP
300k of your own context, subagents excluded. **One run = one unit of work:** the next **2 tasks** of the current
phase's ladder (3 when at most one is ⚑ MAJOR); or one **phase-end run** (the phase's stage/gate-card task + the Fable
phase review + fixes); or one **planning run** (the next phase's plan). Note the opening `<total_tokens>`; before every
dispatch write one line: task, spend so far, next. At ~240k start closing; at 300k finish the in-flight task only, then
CLOSE. Partial progress is progress: merge what is green, say what is not.

## READ FIRST (in order)
1. This file, then `docs/QUESTIONS.md` (act on any new text under an item's `Answer:` before anything else — it is an
   authorization for exactly what it says; record it in DECISIONS). Open: **Q2** (the Phase 2 gate card — Ben DEFERRED it
   until he is back; not a verdict, keep it open; if he later answers (b)/(c), his notes become Phase 2 fix tasks — plan
   them FIRST and say so in LOOP-LOG). Q1, Q3, Q4 are answered and acted on (run 13: Q4 → D37 + plan task GP; Q3 → D35
   addendum).
2. `CLAUDE.md`; `docs/STATE.md` (whole file); `docs/DECISIONS.md` **D33** (Phase 2 as built), **D34** (the loop's
   authorizations), **D35** (Phase 3 rulings + its "As built (loop run 9 … 13)" paragraphs), **D37** (Ferazel controller).
3. **The plan: `docs/plans/2026-10-14-ferazel-phase3.md`** — Verification model (l. 69), Invariants + Hazards (l. 129),
   Shared architecture LOCKED (l. 209), this run's task sections (**S1 l. 1135, P1 l. 1186**), Execution order (l. 1443),
   Bank corrections (l. 1590, each task appends the BCs it relies on), Rulings (l. 1703). Line numbers are as of run 13's
   close. Read the "⚑ As executed" bullets of L1 (l. 781), M1 (l. 910), F1a (l. 1010), D1 (l. 1048), F1b (l. 1117) — the
   `LevelRun`, `WorldMapRun` and `GameFlow` APIs S1/P1 extend, and where the dump beat the plan.
4. The bank files and dump ranges each task section cites (`docs/ferazel/*.md`, `ghidra/ferazel/`).

## RECONCILE FIRST (before any dispatch — the chip can be stale)
1. `git -C "$REPO" worktree list` and `git -C "$REPO" branch --list 'loop/*'`: a leftover `loop-*` worktree or branch
   means an earlier run did not merge. Read its log; if its commits pass the gates, rebase them onto `main` in YOUR
   worktree (cherry-pick), re-run G2, continue from there; otherwise record it in LOOP-LOG + QUESTIONS and start from
   `main`. Never delete another run's worktree or branch.
2. `git -C "$REPO" log --oneline -8 main` and `git -C "$REPO" status --porcelain`: the STATE block below must name
   main's head. If main moved past it, re-derive the state from `main` + `docs/LOOP-LOG.md` + the plan's "as executed"
   ladder, and fix this file in this run. If Ben's main checkout is dirty, never touch those files; merge `--ff-only`
   still works when the dirty paths are not in your diff.
3. Run G2 once from your worktree before dispatching (3–4 min): the count must equal the STATE block's. Any other
   number is Invariant 10: STOP the task, reconcile, record.
4. `git -C ~/Developer/HectorKit status --porcelain` empty and `log -1` = the HK SHA below (**35a85ba**, or a later local
   main that a previous run or Ben recorded in STATE); a dirty HectorKit checkout is Ben's — do not touch it; use an HK
   worktree.

## STATE (live, 2026-10-24, written by loop run 13 at its close; head of `main` = run 13's docs-close commit on top of 4593041 — read `git log -8 main`)
- **The loop was paused 2026-10-14 → 2026-10-24** (STOP). Meanwhile Ben's attended sessions added controller support to
  Bubble Trouble X (D36, HectorKit D16), released BTX 1.1 as a draft, pushed main, and moved **HectorKit main to
  35a85ba, zero-skip floor 361** (was 0c65dcb / 328). Ferazel/Core is unaffected (308/0 against it, then 323/0).
- **Phase 2 "Ferazel moves" is CLOSED on the machine side** (loop run 7; staged d5586fb → `~/Desktop/Ferazel's Wand.app`).
  **Ben's gate: QUESTIONS Q2 — DEFERRED until he is back** (not a verdict).
- **Phase 3 "Front end + saves" is UNDER WAY** (plan `docs/plans/2026-10-14-ferazel-phase3.md`, D35 + its "As built"
  paragraphs, D37). **Waves 3.0–3.4 CLOSED.** Done: X1 256, R1 260, SV1 ⚑ 266 (run 9); SV2 272, FE0 ⚑ 278, O1 284
  (run 10); L2 289, L1 ⚑ 297 (run 11); RX 297, M1 ⚑ 305, M2 308 (run 12); **run 13:** F1a (24330a0) 313, D1 (b63332e)
  317, review fixes 75c6052, F1b ⚑ (9cc9d01 + test fix 4593041) 323. Wave 3.4 end gates G3 + G5 green.
  **Remaining ladder:** **S1 ⚑ 330 → P1 335** → C1 ⚑ 342 → C2 345 → A1a ⚑, A1b ⚑ (app, no tests) → **GP 349** (D37,
  controller) → A2 phase end. Runs: **[S1 P1]**, [C1 C2], [A1a A1b], [GP] + phase end.
- `Ferazel/Core` suite: **323 passed, 0 failed/skipped**. Census `Totals: items 1,108 decoded, failures 0`. HectorKit
  `~/Developer/HectorKit` main **35a85ba**, clean, floor **361** (no HK change this phase).
- Worktrees: `inspiring-cannon-e97ccd` (deimos-phase2) and `~/Developer/gamepad-wt/Ambrosia-Classics` (branch
  `gamepad`, merged) are Ben's — never touch. Run 13's own worktree is the looper's to remove.
- Goldens (unchanged by run 13): Phase 1 `9db8f32f7e3d88b4` / `b80b0efd384ffdb9` / pan 30 `172596fa2f3b6c58` / pan 60
  `cc9786ba763d383a` / chain `b4230ba5a643c5b5`; Phase 2 L2 `565e867a02736c18` / `df22325e851e782d`, jump
  `e4f4bf977dd98eaa`, swim `95ff5176412df650`, 600-frame chain `9532d65a42d39666` / cues `a875a96c2801dbe9`; Phase 3
  main-menu screen `ed142fed9e3bdce7` (FE0), world map first frame `38563faaa2276f05` (M2), map RNG `0x7b052a62` (M1).
- **Carries for the next tasks** (full lists in the "⚑ As executed" bullets):
  to **S1/P1**: `GameFlow` (F1a/F1b) drives `LevelRun` / `WorldMapRun` / `DeathScreen`; the map's Caps Lock pause point is a
  `// later: P1` stub in `WorldMapRun.swift`; `.Options` is built in Core (F1a) — P1's pause loop reuses it; the save
  point (S1) writes through `SaveBlock.savePointSave(…, globals: inout, records:)` and `FrontFiles.writeSavedGame` with
  `PutFileRequest` (FE0). To **A1a**: route `GameFlow.segments` (screen / level / map, in order — draw from the segments
  only; sounds/music/requests are per tick) → `ScreenRenderer` / `FrameRenderer` / `MapRenderer`; set `startLevel`
  (`FerazelLevel`), `soundLengths`, `dateTime`; **load 4803/4804 even with F1 (sound loading off)** — `.InitAppGlobals`
  loads them unconditionally; two App load phases (`loadProgress(faces:)` + `loadFinished()`); move the app onto
  GameFlow (then the non-hosted per-iteration cursor path and the three ◇ `.loadLevel`/`.deathEffect` LevelFlowTests go,
  plan-named); fill `FrontInput.capsLock` and the `StageSounds` length table from `SoundBank`; with a shared surface
  `FrameRenderer` does not set the level CLUT at init. To **A1b**: render `.Options` from `GameFlow.prefsDialog` (Core
  owns the sequence). To **GP**: plan task GP (D37) — layout table, `padContext` on GameFlow, BTX exemplar.
- **Lessons (runs 9–13):** (1) the plan's "digest A–F" were never committed — ground on the bank files + the dump (say so
  in every brief); (2) the plan is wrong against the dump about once per task — the dump wins, the as-executed bullet
  records it (run 13: 4 places in F1b, 3 in F1a, the TurnGray restore in D1); (3) run the seat's own gates from the
  worktree once no agent is building; (4) `Agent` calls return async here — **stay in the turn**: block in ≤10-minute
  Bash loops that poll the branch head (`git log -1 | grep -q '<commit subject>'`) with the sleep inside the loop; the
  completion notice arrives between tool calls; (5) independent work runs side by side when files are disjoint (run 13:
  F1a ∥ D1, each with its own `--scratch-path`; F1b's two review legs in parallel ∥ the seat's G3/G5); (6) a fix round
  that changes behaviour gets a re-review — or the seat reads the diff itself when it is a one-line guard (run 13); (7) a
  fix that moves an existing expectation is reverted and becomes a NAMED plan task (Invariant 10); (8) Opus reviewers'
  mutation runs are the best signal — a test-strengthening round adds assertions inside the existing test functions so
  the ladder total holds.

## THIS RUN'S JOB — Phase 3 run 6: **[S1 P1]** (wave 3.5; one ⚑ MAJOR)
- **S1 — ⚑ MAJOR — the frame suspension seam and the save point (→ 330)**, plan l. 1135–1185 (7 tests). **Two Opus legs.**
- **P1 — minor — `.CheckGameLoopKeys` and `.Pause` (→ 335)**, plan l. 1186–1237 (5 tests; replaces M1's `// later: P1`
  map pause stub). One Opus leg. P1 depends on S1 (suspension) — sequential; P1's implementer may start while S1's
  review legs run only if their files are disjoint (check the plan's file lists; `LevelRun.swift` and
  `FerazelSession.swift` are shared → normally sequential).
- Wave 3.5 end: G3 + G5. Close: plan "⚑ As executed" bullets per task, D35 "As built" paragraph, STATE, memory, this
  file, LOOP-LOG. If the cap allows nothing more after S1, close with P1 as the next run's first task.

```

## AUTHORIZATIONS (Ben, 2026-10-13, AskUserQuestion in the setup session — D34; a loop run inherits nothing else)
- **Scope:** the whole game, phases 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 in design §8 order. **Gates queue, they do not block:** at
  each phase end stage the build (`tools/stage-ferazel.sh` → `out/Ferazel/` + `~/Desktop/Ferazel's Wand.app` +
  `WHAT-TO-EXPECT.md`), run G9, write the gate card as a QUESTIONS item ("Ben: play this; pass looks like …"), log the
  LOOP-LOG line, and the NEXT run **plans the next phase**. Ben's later verdict can re-open a phase (his answer in
  QUESTIONS becomes a task). Completion wording stays "machine gates green; Ben's gate pending" — never "plays like
  Ferazel".
- **Phase plans (3–7):** the loop writes each plan when its turn comes (Opus planner, `superpowers:writing-plans`
  shape, contracts not code — `feedback-plans-carry-contracts-not-code`), against the design + the bank + what landed;
  two Opus review legs; **one Fable review leg**; fixes applied; rulings in a new D-number (check `docs/DECISIONS.md` on
  `main` for the next free number — D31 lives on the unmerged `deimos-phase2` branch, so skip it; after D35 the next
  free is **D38** — D36 is BTX's gamepad, D37 Ferazel's controller); listed in QUESTIONS for Ben's later read; **execution starts the next run without waiting.**
  A phase plan must carry: its own ladder, gate commands with numbers, the stand-ins it keeps (◇, named), the gate card.
- **Run / stage:** launching the staged `.app` for G9 and replacing `~/Desktop/Ferazel's Wand.app` (+ notes + icon
  previews) at each phase end is authorized. Never delete the prefs domain `com.ambrosiaclassics.ferazel` or any other
  `com.ambrosiaclassics.*`. No notarization, no release packaging, no installs of anything (brew/pip/Xcode components):
  those go to QUESTIONS.
- **HectorKit:** when a phase plan needs a kit change, you may commit to HectorKit's **local** `main` — own HK worktree
  (`git -C ~/Developer/HectorKit worktree add …`), `tools/check-zero-skip.sh` floor may only rise (now **361**; bump `FLOOR` in the
  same commit), an HK D-number in `~/Developer/HectorKit/docs/DECISIONS.md`, Classics STATE pins the new HK SHA; merge
  to HK local main `--ff-only`; never push HK either. Keep HectorKit Foundation-only in its core modules (HK D6).
- **Merge:** when every gate of the run is green, `git -C "$REPO" merge --ff-only <your branch>` (rebase onto `main`
  in your worktree first if it moved); `--no-ff` only when the plan's wave-close convention asks for it.
- **Windows (Phase 7)** follows the BTX W-plan shape (D15–D21, `tools/windows/`); the zip is staged, his brother's test
  and the notarized Mac DMG are QUESTIONS (credentials, remote) → when nothing on the ladder can proceed without Ben,
  write `STATUS: BLOCKED` with the list. **Never write `STATUS: DONE` yourself** — DONE is Ben's word.

## NEVER (hazards; each with the safe alternative)
- Never `git push` / `git fetch` / `gh` / any remote; never `git add -A` or `.` (explicit paths); never `git stash`
  (WIP commit instead); never check out, reset, or edit files in Ben's main checkout at `$REPO` (only `merge --ff-only`
  there); never force-anything; never delete a branch or worktree that is not yours.
- Never edit the originals under `Resources/Ferazel/` or the dumps under `ghidra/ferazel/` (regenerate only via
  `ghidra/regen-ferazel.sh`, and this phase never needs to); never hand-edit `AmbrosiaClassics.xcodeproj`
  (`project.yml` is truth, `xcodegen generate`); never touch `~/Developer/Ambrosia`, `~/Developer/Ghidra`,
  `~/Developer/Toolkits` (read-only oracles and method).
- Never edit a golden or an expectation to make a number agree (Invariant 10 — STOP, reconcile, record); the dump beats
  the bank (Ben: "follow the binary"), and a correction is appended to the bank file by the task that relies on it.
- Never add a modern affordance (coyote time, jump buffer, smoothing, collision "fixes", audio normalisation —
  Invariant 7); never "simplify" a named later-phase stub away (Invariant 6).
- Never build Aki / AkiPad / BubbleTroubleX / Deimos / Cythera for a Ferazel-only task (only when `project.yml`,
  HectorKit, or shared Resources change — then build them all); never run `tools/package-*-release.sh`.
- Never let a file that is git-ignored into git by editing `.gitignore` (`/Resources/*` except the three games, `out/`,
  `releases/`, `.build/`, `STOP`, `.looper/logs/`, `hd-4x`); never commit `~/Desktop` paths or scratch logs.
- Never spawn a chip (`spawn_task`), never `EnterWorktree` (you are in one; a session cannot make a second Classics
  worktree — HectorKit worktrees are fine), never `AskUserQuestion` (disabled; use QUESTIONS.md), never use the
  `Workflow` tool; never edit `.looper/config.sh`, the kit under `~/Developer/Toolkits`, or any `~/.claude` settings.
- Traps: `Ferazel/FerazelCore` is a symlink to `Core` (SwiftPM package naming, D13.8); the app name has an apostrophe —
  quote every path; from a worktree HectorKit resolves through the `.claude/worktrees/HectorKit` symlink
  (`HECTORKIT_PATH` overrides); Swift `>>` binds tighter than `&*` (F2 review bug); the bank's wave-1 "handler dump l. N"
  numbers drift — use M lines / raw addresses from the plan; `swift test` prints two "Executed" lines; parallel lanes in
  one worktree need their own `swift test --scratch-path`; agents cannot screenshot on this machine; a reviewer builds
  in a `mktemp` archive, not in your worktree.

## CLOSE (every run, in this order; never start a new task at the cap)
1. Finish the in-flight task (merge what is green; an unfinished task's branch stays, say so).
2. **As-built docs:** the plan's task section gets an "As executed" note (ladder numbers, deviations, bank corrections
   landed); `docs/DECISIONS.md` D33 (or the phase's D-number) "As built" paragraph; `docs/STATE.md` Ferazel bullet
   updated (small by rule — replace, don't append history); the gate card / WHAT-TO-EXPECT only in phase-end runs.
3. **Memory:** one file in `~/.claude/projects/-Users-andiyar-Developer-Ambrosia-Classics/memory/` (project type, what
   landed, SHAs, counts, what the next run must know) + one index line in `MEMORY.md` there.
4. **Rewrite this file** completely for the next run: first line `STATUS: CONTINUE` (or `STATUS: BLOCKED` with the
   QUESTIONS item that blocks); STATE block with the new `main` SHA (the one your merge will produce — verify after the
   merge and amend if needed), test counts, HK SHA/floor, ladder position; THIS RUN'S JOB = the next unit (2 tasks, or
   the phase-end run, or the planning run) grounded to plan lines and file:line; GATES with the next expected numbers;
   AUTHORIZATIONS and NEVER carried verbatim unless Ben changed them in QUESTIONS.
5. **One line in `docs/LOOP-LOG.md`** (the line format in its header: date | run N | what landed | gates | boots |
   merged SHA).
6. QUESTIONS: add any item Ben must decide (the item shape in its header: Context / Options / Recommendation /
   Blocks / Answer:); move answered items you acted on to "Answered".
7. Commit the docs (explicit paths), G10 clean, **merge `--ff-only` into `main` at `$REPO`**, confirm
   `git -C "$REPO" log --oneline -1` is your commit. The looper removes your worktree and branch once merged.
8. **No chips, no handoff file, no closing offers.** Your last message: what landed, what review caught, what the next
   run does — plain English, for a reader who did not see this run.
