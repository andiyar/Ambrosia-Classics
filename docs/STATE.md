# STATE — Ambrosia Classics — 2026-10-03 (night)

> Live state only. Dated; re-verify before acting. Narrative goes in handoffs, forks in DECISIONS.

## Where we are

- **Phase 0 DONE (2026-10-03).** HectorKit **v0.1.0** (`~/Developer/HectorKit`, tag on f578925): HectorResources /
  HectorGraphics / HectorAudio lifted from EV e23122f + the new banded-QuickTime decoder; machine gate
  `tools/check-zero-skip.sh` PASS at **floor 119** (0 skips with the three `HECTORKIT_DATA_*` vars; EV Override
  forks + Aki 1.1 data). Classics: `Aki/Core` (AkiCore + `aki-census` + 6 data-gated tests, 6/6) and
  `docs/aki/data-census.md` (tool output: 82 PICT = 71 QuickTime + 11 raw, all decode to frame; 50 PNG; 14 + 15
  audio files open; 0 `snd `). Plan: `docs/plans/2026-10-03-phase0-hectorkit-lift.md` (DONE).
- **Replica target is 1.2.0** (Ben's ruling 2026-10-03, recorded by the RE lane in `docs/aki/INDEX.md`; all
  1.1↔1.2 deltas resolve to 1.2). Art therefore comes from the 1.2.0 PNGs (same native sizes as the 1.1 PICTs;
  `data-census.md` §3 maps them); the PICT path stays as oracle and for Bubble Trouble.
- **RE-bank lane COMPLETE (2026-10-03, head 01cb120):** `docs/aki/`, `docs/bubble-trouble/`, `docs/cythera/`,
  `docs/deimos/`, `docs/ferazel/` — each Opus-built, Fable-reviewed (all ACCEPT_WITH_FIXES), fix-passed;
  handoff `docs/handoff-2026-10-03-re-bank.md`; optional deepening = RESUME Trigger A2.
- **Deimos RE deepening, wave 1 landed (2026-10-03 night):** nine gameplay files in `docs/deimos/` (movement, spawn sets, weapons, damage, player, scoring, unit-def structs, bosses, level/scroll), Fable-reviewed ACCEPT_WITH_FIXES + fix-passed; role table 293→510 rows (240 HIGH / 256 MED / 14 LOW); INDEX closes #7 #17 #19 #20 #22 #24 #25 #26 #28. Wave 2 (sprite geometry, particles/RNG, timing, HUD, messages, loose ends, sound, front end) in flight.
- **Originals:** Aki 1.1.0 + 1.2.0 UB (symlinked as git-ignored `Resources/Aki/1.1.0.app`, `1.2.0.app`);
  Bubble Trouble X 1.1 UB; Ferazel's Wand 1.0.3, Deimos Rising 1.0.6, Cythera 1.0.4 (PEF).
  Archive map: `~/Developer/Ambrosia/docs/ARCHIVE-INDEX.md`.
- **Local-path dependency:** `Aki/Core` → `../../../HectorKit`; a worktree needs the untracked symlink
  `.claude/worktrees/HectorKit → ~/Developer/HectorKit` (Classics DECISIONS D1).

- **Bubble Trouble X core lane (2026-10-03 night, Fable orchestrator, cap lifted by Ben):** plans LOCKED
  (`docs/plans/2026-10-03-btx-core-and-film-harness.md` 18 tasks; `2026-10-03-hectorkit-btx-decoders.md`);
  core Tasks 0–3b + T12 bank corrections merged (44 tests green at 48e29db); HectorKit main 5a33384 = BTX locator,
  snd census, `CIcon`, `PixelPattern` (renamed from PixPat: SDK collision), docs D5, floor 160, **tag v0.2.0 pending**.
  In flight on lane branches when the session hit its usage limit: core `btx-t4` (Task 4 level build), kit `btx-pict`
  (Task 4a masked PICT), Classics `btx-census` (kit Task 7). Lane worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/btx-*` and
  `~/Developer/HectorKit-btx*`. Honest bar: FILM oracle = replay to count exhaustion + golden freeze (bank derives no
  end state); hero-balloon pop reads outside the enemy array (NR-6, level ≥ 6 only) carried as an open quirk.

## Open, ordered

1. **Phase 1 — HectorShell + Aki static screens** (Trigger C in `docs/RESUME.md`): brainstorm → plan → build.
   800x600 logical canvas, integer-crisp / fit-smooth scaling (design §4a), Metal vs CALayer decided by
   measuring (§7); splash (`welcome.png`), map (`map.png` + lanterns), prefs dialog from the 1.2 nibs' strings.
   First staged `.app` for Ben: gate "that is Aki's map screen".
2. ~~RE-bank lane~~ done. **Chips issued 2026-10-03 evening (Ben's call, parallel sessions):** Bubble Trouble X build
   (core + FILM replay oracle first, shell last); RE deepening ×3 — Deimos gameplay code, Ferazel open items, Cythera
   script disassembly → rules. All Opus 5.5 subagents, wide fan-out authorised, Fable-grade review per wave.
3. Phases 2–3 Aki, then Bubble Trouble X shell on HectorShell (design §6). EV's adoption of HectorKit (re-export shim): separate task.

## Carried (not blockers)

- Design doc §4 says 70 QuickTime / 12 raw PICTs; the data says 71 / 11 (PICT 135 is 32-bit cmpCount 4 — a
  real alpha plane). Fix the design doc when it is next edited.
- HectorKit carries EV-engine arithmetic in `SndSound` (`loadSoundsTicks`, `playbackDurationFrames`) by the
  "rename prefixes only" rule; trim only with a ruling. Only data-gated tests cover `snd` format 1.
- `quickTimeBands` returns a tuple, not a struct (API polish for v0.2). No dimension cap on codec images.
- Ambrosia's 1996 installer format unreversed. HD-art packs late polish. Licence at the very end (EV D65).
- **Ferazel RE deepening (2026-10-03, CLOSED 2026-10-04):** 11 Opus readers + 2 gap readers wrote 17 new `docs/ferazel/` files (~6,400 lines: enemies ×3, bosses ×2, enemy-shots-and-damage, pickups-boxes, triggers-background ×2, spells-detail, save-continue, platforms-ropes-radial, player-states ×2, geysers, held-item-melee, coverage, physics-sprites); three Fable review legs all ACCEPT_WITH_FIXES (1a 0/4/6, 1b 1 Critical/3/9, 1c 0/4/11; `REVIEW-2026-10-03-deepening.md`); fix passes 1a/1b landed; consolidated fix pass landed (`FIXPASS-2026-10-03-deepening.md`; labels HIGH 727 / MED 228 / LOW 27); merged to main at 5b15177. Fable spot-review 1d of the fix-pass diff (2026-10-04): ACCEPT_WITH_FIXES, 0 Critical / 0 Important / 6 Minor, 66/66 markers + 76 raw addresses confirmed; fixes + the held-item-melee carries (rows 3, 4, 6–8) landed at 02f29cc. Worktree and branch `recursing-rhodes-932ac0` removed. Still open in the bank: INDEX NOT-RESOLVED items 15–29 (`+0xb8` draw modes, tint/remap colours, NewParticle args, Xichra cannons, OmniPx/PxMid, Mcnv item 3, lighting item 10, Titles item 12). Nothing needs Ben's play check. Handoff `docs/handoff-2026-10-03-ferazel-re.md`.
